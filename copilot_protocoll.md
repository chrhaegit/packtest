# Q & A with copilot about packages in python

## Q1

my filestructure is package1/main1.py, package1/one.py where main1.py is importing the class One: from one import One. If I run python from the project root with: python -m package1.main1,  I get the error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'one'. Why? I thought __init__.py is not needed, since I run python 3.12.3

## A1

The issue you're encountering is due to how Python resolves module imports when using the -m option. Even though Python 3.3 and later support implicit namespace packages (meaning __init__.py is not strictly necessary), the way you run your script affects how imports are resolved.
When you run python -m package1.main1, Python treats package1 as a top-level package. Therefore, the import statement from one import One in main1.py looks for a module named one in the top-level namespace, not within package1.
To fix this, you should modify the import statement in main1.py to be relative:

```python
from .one import One
```

This tells Python to look for one.py within the same package (package1).
Your directory structure should look like this:

```python
project_directory/
│
├── package1/
│   ├── main1.py
│   └── one.py
```

With this change, running the command:

```python
python -m package1.main1
```

should work without raising a ModuleNotFoundError.
Would you like any further assistance with your project?

## Q2

worked but I have a new problem: I have an additional package2/two.py. I imported it in main1.py like: from ..package2.two import Two and I got ImportError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package. How to fix this?

## A2

## Copilot

The error ImportError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package occurs because relative imports are only allowed within the same top-level package. When you try to import package2.two from package1.main1 using a relative import, Python doesn't allow it because package2 is not a subpackage of package1.
To fix this, you should use an absolute import instead. Modify your import statement in main1.py to:

```python
from package2.two import Two
```

This way, Python will correctly locate package2 as a top-level package.
Your directory structure should look like this:

```python
project_directory/
│
├── package1/
│   ├── main1.py
│   └── one.py
│
├── package2/
│   └── two.py
```

With this setup, running the command:

```python
python -m package1.main1
```

should work without any import errors.
